# Palindrome Checker

This is a palindrome checker script created as part of the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course on freecodecamp.org.

## Objective

Create a script that returns true if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, return false.
You'll need to remove all non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, spaces and symbols) and turn everything into the same case (lower or upper case) in order to check for palindromes.
